# Instagusto

Instagusto is an efficient Instagram bot that helps you gain thousands of followers and likes by providing likes to the hashtags you specify. It utilizes the power of Selenium to automate interactions with the Instagram platform.

## Requirements

To run Instagusto, you need the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: Ensure that you have a version of Python installed on your computer.

- **Selenium**: Install Selenium for Python by running the following command:

$ pip install selenium

- **Geckodriver**: InstaGusto is designed to work with the Mozilla Firefox browser, but it can be configured to work with other browsers as well. To use Instagusto with Firefox, you need to install Geckodriver, which acts as a bridge between Selenium and Firefox.

- Download Geckodriver from the official repository: [Geckodriver Releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

- Extract the Geckodriver files and locate the installation folder.

- Move the Geckodriver executable file to a directory in your system's PATH. For example, if you're using Linux, you can use the following command from the terminal:
  ```
  $ sudo mv geckodriver /usr/bin
  ```

## Usage

To run Instagusto, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Change the current directory to the folder where you have the Instagusto code.

3. Run the Instagusto script using the following command:

$ python instagusto.py

## Additional Information

- Instagusto is currently optimized to work with the Mozilla Firefox browser, but you can configure it to work with other browsers supported by Selenium. Please refer to the Selenium documentation for more information: [Selenium Documentation](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
