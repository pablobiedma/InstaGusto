In this case I used the bot for the mozilla firefox browser but if you look into it you can use any of
them.

To run this bot you’ll need:

A version of ​ python ​ installed in your computer.

Install ​ selenium ​ for python to run the bot in the browser. ​$ pip install selenium

Install ​ geckodriver ​ from github

Find geckodriver installation folder and get it out of that folder as you’ll need it together with your
program to run it.

From the terminal cd into the directory of the geckodriver and type in:
$ move geckodriver ​/user/bin

Run the code
